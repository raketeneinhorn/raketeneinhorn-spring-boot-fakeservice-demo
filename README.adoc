= Raketeneinhorn Spring Boot Fakeservice Demo

A small project showing how to automatically create a  standalone version of a Spring Boot service replacing parts of
the service with fake code to eliminate dependencies on other resources.

== Motivation

Often a service has a dependency on another resource (other service, database, â€¦) which it needs to be fully functional.

So it can be cumbersome to use such a dependant service as the dependency of another service as the whole chain of
dependencies needs to be present. Even as those "coupled" services should be avoided, there are situations where this is
hard to achieve.

To address this problem a second service eliminating the dependencies can be automatically created alongside the
original service by replacing the code that uses the dependencies with fake code that does not have any dependencies,
effectively creating a standalone version of the service.

WARNING: This standalone service can be used for fast tests or as a local resource. As the fake service does not run the
same code as the original service the original service has to be thoroughly tested with its dependencies, e.g. using
integrative testing.

== Project structure

The xref:fakeservice-demo-base[fakeservice-demo-base] subproject contains a typical Spring Boot service that has been
built as a xref:https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/java_library_plugin.html[java-library] and contains the
service code.

The xref:fakeservice-demo-service[fakeservice-demo-service] and xref:fakeservice-demo-fake[fakeservice-demo-fake]
subprojects are xref:https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/application_plugin.html[applications] and are
used to create the application's docker images.

The
xref:fakeservice-demo-base/src/main/java/com/raketeneinhorn/spring/boot/fakeservice/demo/core/unicorn[unicorn] package
contains a typical
xref:fakeservice-demo-base/src/main/java/com/raketeneinhorn/spring/boot/fakeservice/demo/core/unicorn/UnicornController.java[controller]
with service setup. The
xref:fakeservice-demo-base/src/main/java/com/raketeneinhorn/spring/boot/fakeservice/demo/core/unicorn/NiceUnicornService.java[NiceUnicornService]
is injected into
xref:fakeservice-demo-base/src/main/java/com/raketeneinhorn/spring/boot/fakeservice/demo/core/unicorn/UnicornController.java[UnicornController]
based on the
xref:fakeservice-demo-base/src/main/java/com/raketeneinhorn/spring/boot/fakeservice/demo/core/unicorn/UnicornService.java[UnicornService]
interface.
