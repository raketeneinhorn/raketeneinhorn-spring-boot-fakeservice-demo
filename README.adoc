A small project showing how to automatically create a  standalone version of a Spring Boot service replacing parts of
the service with fake code to eliminate dependencies on other resources.

== Motivation

Often a service has a dependency on another resource (other service, database, â€¦) which it needs to be fully functional.

So it can be cumbersome to use such a dependant service as the dependency of another service as the whole chain of
dependencies needs to be present. Even as those "coupled" services should be avoided, there are situations where this is
hard to achieve.

To address this problem a second service eliminating the dependencies can be automatically created alongside the
original service by replacing the code that uses the dependencies with fake code that does not have any dependencies,
effectively creating a standalone version of the service.

WARNING: This standalone service can be used for fast tests or as a local resource. As the fake service does not run the
same code as the original service the original service has to be thoroughly tested with its dependencies, e.g. using
integrative testing.

== Project structure

The link:./fakeservice-demo-base[fakeservice-demo-base] subproject contains a typical Spring Boot service that has been
built as a xref:https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/java_library_plugin.html[java-library] and contains the
service code.

The link:./fakeservice-demo-service[fakeservice-demo-service] and link:./fakeservice-demo-fake[fakeservice-demo-fake]
subprojects are xref:https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/application_plugin.html[applications] and are
used to create the application's docker images.

The
xref:fakeservice-demo-base/src/main/java/com/raketeneinhorn/spring/boot/fakeservice/demo/core/unicorn[unicorn package]
contains a typical
xref:fakeservice-demo-base/src/main/java/com/raketeneinhorn/spring/boot/fakeservice/demo/core/unicorn/UnicornController.java[controller]
with service setup. The
xref:fakeservice-demo-base/src/main/java/com/raketeneinhorn/spring/boot/fakeservice/demo/core/unicorn/NiceUnicornService.java[`NiceUnicornService`]
is injected into
xref:fakeservice-demo-base/src/main/java/com/raketeneinhorn/spring/boot/fakeservice/demo/core/unicorn/UnicornController.java[`UnicornController`]
based on the
xref:fakeservice-demo-base/src/main/java/com/raketeneinhorn/spring/boot/fakeservice/demo/core/unicorn/UnicornService.java[`UnicornService`]
interface.

== How does it work

=== Technologies

==== Spring Boot

The project combines uses the following Spring Boot mechanisms:

- https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/api/java/org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/condition/ConditionalOnMissingBean.html[`@ConditionalOnMissingBean`]
allows to specify ``@Bean``s that are only created when no other beans of that type can be found in the application
context.
- https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/annotation/Primary.html[`@Primary`]
gives a bean precedence when multiple candidates can be found.

==== Gradle

On the Gradle side of things it uses:

- https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/sharing_build_logic_between_subprojects.html#sec:convention_plugins[Convention plugins]
to provide the build logic for the three subprojects.

=== Implementation

==== Spring Boot

In
xref:fakeservice-demo-base/src/main/java/com/raketeneinhorn/spring/boot/fakeservice/demo/core/unicorn/UnicornConfiguration.java[`UnicornConfiguration`]
we define `@Bean` of type
xref:fakeservice-demo-base/src/main/java/com/raketeneinhorn/spring/boot/fakeservice/demo/core/unicorn/UnicornService.java[`UnicornService`]
which only should be created if no UnicornService is found. As the base subproject only contains one class that
implements the `UnicornService` interface this means that a
xref:fakeservice-demo-base/src/main/java/com/raketeneinhorn/spring/boot/fakeservice/demo/core/unicorn/NiceUnicornService.java[`NiceUnicornService`]
is created.

By using `@ConditionalOnMissingBean` we create an extension point: When a different `UnicornService` implementation is
found in the application context it is used instead of the `NiceUnicornService`.

This leveraged in the link:./fakeservice-demo-fake[fakeservice-demo-fake], which has a custom `UnicornService` class:
xref:fakeservice-demo-fake/src/main/java/com/raketeneinhorn/spring/boot/fakeservice/demo/fake/core/unicorn/EvilUnicornService.java[`EvilUnicornService`]
which is marked as `@Primary` will override the `NiceUnicornService` from
link:./fakeservice-demo-base[fakeservice-demo-base].

Any of the projects can be run with:

 gradle bootRun

==== Docker images

While the link:./fakeservice-demo-base[fakeservice-demo-base] subproject contains the main sourcecode we rely on the other
two subprojcts to produce
https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/reference/packaging/container-images/index.html[container images]:

- link:./fakeservice-demo-fake[fakeservice-demo-fake] creates the fake standalone image and contains the Java code as
described above.
- link:./fakeservice-demo-service[fakeservice-demo-service] creates the actual service image to be used in production
and only contains a dependency on the base project.

Any of the projects can be
https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/gradle-plugin/packaging-oci-image.html[packaged as an OCI image] by running:

 gradle bootBuildImage
